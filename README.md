## Laborator 1

In this workshop I've explored GitHub and touched on some markdown features such as: 

- Title
- Paragraphs
- Unordered lists

### Git

Git commands I've learned so far:

- git init (this command is used to initiate a new git within a project)
- git add ([<file_name1, file_name2> - used to add a file or multiple files].
           [--all - will add all the files or changes to  the repository.])
- git status (this command will display the state of the created repository    or staging area.)
- git branch (this command is used to list all the branches from the repository)
- git push (this command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository)
- git pull (this command is used to download content from a remote repository to the local one.)
- git commit (this command is used to save changes to the local repository. The "-a" flag allows to commit all modified files.)
- git reset (this command helps you to undo the local changes to the state of a Git repository.)
